You are a thinker, a loner, and tend to hide your true ideas. You don't express your feelings with sweet words, so you often leave others with the impression that 'It's none of my business'. If you want to be more social, you might as well try to embrace and accept people; respect and understand the diversity of society. It would be great if you can find like-minded friends or trustworthy partners and express your emotional needs and true thoughts bravely to them. And try to care more about others to warm up your heart a bit.</p>\",\n      \"<h3 class='subtip-result-stick' data-tip-id='2'>Suspicious</h3>\\n<p>You are perceptive and insecure. Sometimes you may fall into pessimism, which creates imaginary enemies for yourself. You have a strong sense of self-defense and cannot trust others easily. If you want to live a more relaxed and natural life, why not try starting with 'don't think too much'? When under pressure, you tend to doubt everything around you. In cases such as these, it is better to shift your attention and relax your tense nerves. Remember, don't think too much or too deeply about everything.</p>\",\n      \"<h3 class='subtip-result-stick' data-tip-id='4'>Manipulative</h3>\\n<p>You have a distinctive sense of love and hate, just like a hero. You are decisive and assertive, which makes you strive for the best in everything, but also can put pressure on others. However, a powerful person is never afraid to show weakness. Want to become more approachable? It's a good idea to start listening to other people's opinions and learn to respect and think in other ways. Meanwhile, you could also pay more attention to your words and describe your thoughts gracefully. Admitting your weaknesses is actually a way to free yourself from the state of preparedness.</p>\",\n      \"<h3 class='subtip-result-stick' data-tip-id='5'>Paranoid</h3>\\n<p>You are a determined person with strong beliefs in your own knowledge and faith. You are always so demanding of yourself that you would never cut corners to achieve any goals in your life. However, occasional bouts of stubbornness will cloud your vision and build up your ego. It's probably time for you to start trusting the people around you, and appreciating their existence. Listen more, understand more, and reply to them accordingly instead of being like the same-old 'tough lemon' you've always been, so you can feel the joy that stable social relationships bring you. You'll find that listening to different opinions extensively certainly helps a lot, especially when it comes to the major decisions in life.</p>\\n\",\n      \"<h3 class='subtip-result-stick' data-tip-id='6'>Dramatic</h3>\\n<p>You often find confidence through the gaze of others. Therefore, although you may often look radiant and glamorous, over time, your dramatic thoughts and actions - and even a severely emotional, impulsive personality - can cause people around you to reject and alienate you. To get rid of the 'exaggerated' label, you can start by listening more to the real voice around you. Don't try to get others' attention and compliments, and don't be overly concerned about what others think. In addition, looking directly at your true, imperfect self can help you become better.</p>\",\n      \"<h3 class='subtip-result-stick' data-tip-id='3'>Calculating</h3>\\n<p>You are pragmatic and used to thinking rationally in everything. You even think about getting the most out of everything you say and do. However, this can also make you weary and get you labeled as 'petty' and 'selfish' by others. As the saying goes, 'every man for himself, and the Devil take the hindmost'. But sometimes, too much attention to your interests can lead to narrow-mindedness. How about starting to change yourself by 'losing out'? This is not really to suffer financial or spiritual losses, but to take your eyes off of yourself, to open up your horizons, and to find more beauty and joy in your life.</p>\\n\"\n    ]\n}",

Your fluency in $LANG$ and expertise in content writing ensure high-quality translations. You meticulously consider each translation, ensuring it is well localized and culturally adapted for native $LANG$ speakers. Your translations do not sound like machine translations; they are very natural and smooth while always being accurate.\n\nNow, I need you to translate the following HTML content into $LANG$. Please do not explain your response.\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n<h2 class='extra-full'>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<h3>What is an alignment test?</h3>\n<p>An alignment test is a quiz or assessment designed to determine a person’s moral and ethical outlook, as defined by the nine alignments in Dungeons & Dragons.</p>\n<p>\nThe <em>Alignment Test</em>, also known as the <em>D&D Alignment Test</em> or the <em>Moral Alignment Test</em>, is a single test that goes by multiple names.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>How do the alignments work?</h3>\n<p>Alignment in <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> is typically represented by a two-word phrase such as <em>Lawful Good</em>, <em>Neutral Evil</em> or <em>Chaotic Neutral</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The first word of the phrase indicates the character’s ethics, reflecting their stance towards society and authority. It represents whether they value order and hierarchy or individuality and freedom.</p>\n\n<p>The second word of the phrase describes the character’s morals, indicating whether they prioritize helping or harming others. It reflects their willingness to protect or harm people, and whether their actions are motivated by altruism or malevolence.</p>\n\n\n<h3>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h3>\n\n<p>Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop RPG created by <i>Gary Gygax</i> and <i>Dave Arneson</i> and published in 1974. In the game, players create characters and embark on adventures in a fantasy world. The game is guided by a Dungeon Master (DM) who narrates the story and controls non-player characters and monsters. Players use dice to determine the outcomes of their actions, while their characters gain experience and develop abilities over time. D&D is known for its immersive storytelling, complex rules, and emphasis on creativity and collaboration.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Can I take the test without any knowledge of DnD games?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you can take the alignment test without any prior knowledge of D&D games. Our instructions for each alignment type are comprehensive and use straightforward language and examples, so anyone can understand their results, regardless of their level of experience with the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Why should I take the alignment test?</h3>\n\n<p>An alignment test can offer a <b>deeper understanding of your moral and ethical beliefs</b>, as well as your <b>decision-making style</b> and <b>core values</b>. By identifying which of the nine D&D alignments you fall into, the test can provide insights into your <b>personality traits</b>, <b>strengths</b>, and <b>weaknesses</b>. This self-knowledge can be valuable in personal growth and can help you make decisions that align with your true self. As a result, taking an alignment test can be a fun and engaging way to learn more about yourself and your unique perspective on the world.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>What is the difference between “ethical” and “moral” ?\n</h3>\n<p><em>“Moral”</em> refers to principles of right and wrong based on a particular belief system or cultural context. In contrast, <em>“ethical”</em> refers to principles of right and wrong based on a broader sense of fairness and justice, often universal across cultures and belief systems. Moral principles guide behavior in a given society, while ethical principles apply across different contexts and focus on concepts like honesty, integrity, and respect for others.\n</p>\n<p>A defense lawyer is a good example of distinguishing between these two terms. Defense lawyers have their own personal moral code, which prompts them to believe that killing is an immoral and reprehensible act. However, another moral code, legal ethics, requires them to do everything in their power to defend the accused, even if they believe that the defendant is guilty and that their release may pose a greater danger to society. In this case, legal ethics must transcend personal moral beliefs in order to better uphold a judicial system that can provide fair judgments for defendants.\n</p>",
